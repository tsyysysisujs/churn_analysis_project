# Customer Churn Analysis Project

## Overview

Customer churn refers to the loss of clients or customers. Understanding why customers leave is crucial for businesses aiming to improve retention and profitability. This project analyzes a real-world customer churn dataset to identify the main factors contributing to churn and provides actionable insights for reducing customer attrition.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following main directories and files:

- **Churn_project/**
  - `my churned.sql`:  
    Contains SQL scripts used for data extraction, transformation, and analysis. These scripts help in cleaning the data, performing exploratory analysis, and generating insights about customer churn.
- **Dataset/**
  - `02 Customer Churn-Dataset.xlsx`:  
    The primary dataset for the project. It includes customer demographics, account information, and churn status, which are used for analysis and modeling.
- **Summary And Conclusion/**
  - `CHURN ANALYSIS PROJECT SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION.pdf`:  
    A comprehensive PDF report summarizing the analysis process, key findings, and business recommendations based on the results.
- **README.md**:  
    This file provides an overview and instructions for the project.

## Dataset Description

The dataset (`02 Customer Churn-Dataset.xlsx`) contains information such as:
- Customer demographics (age, gender, etc.)
- Account details (tenure, services subscribed, etc.)
- Usage patterns
- Churn status (whether the customer left or stayed)

This data is used to perform:
- Business insights generation

## How to Use This Project

1. **Explore the Dataset**
   - Open the Excel file in the `Dataset/` folder to review the raw data.
   - Familiarize yourself with the columns and types of information available.

2. **Run SQL Analysis**
   - Use the SQL scripts in `Churn_project/my churned.sql` to process and analyze the data.
   - You will need a SQL environment (such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQLite) to execute these scripts.
   - The scripts may include:
     - Data cleaning and preprocessing steps
     - Calculations of churn rates
     - Identification of key churn drivers

3. **Review Results and Insights**
   - After running the analysis, review the findings and visualizations (if any).
   - For a comprehensive summary, read the PDF report in `Summary And Conclusion/`.
   - The report includes:
     - A summary of the analysis process
     - Key findings and patterns
     - Recommendations for reducing churn

## Summary and Results

The analysis aims to answer questions such as:
- What are the main reasons customers leave?
- Which customer segments are most at risk of churning?
- What actions can the business take to improve retention?

The final PDF report provides a detailed summary of these findings and offers actionable recommendations.
